SO DELICIOUS!\n\nHowever, NOW there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last years red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  Fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so I only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.\n\nThe portions are big and filling, just dont come for the ice cream.', '12/23/2016', 3);

We walked in the door and their was no hostess which is understandable if they are busy but they really were not. We had at least five servers look dead at us as well as cooks and stood there for a good five minutes and still no one said anything to us so we walked out and went to the McDonalds across the street.', '2/12/2015', 1);

Frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  Kings Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.\n\nWe chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:\n\nTea\nPepsi\nOpen-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy\nBuffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n cheese Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didnt taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didnt feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didnt taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  \n\nI tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasnt the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didnt taste bad.', '12/13/2015', 3);

First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it is best, it is like a floor show with the actor is backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and dont forget the italian toast. Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I dont think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee is good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.

If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have dippy eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a dippy egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.
